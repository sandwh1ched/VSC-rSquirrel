# rSquirrel

## Synopsis
A VS Code extension that adds support for Respawn Entertainment's Squirrel
derivative language, rSquirrel.

Unfortunately, at this time, the extension cannot be uploaded onto the Open VSX
Registry as there are some account issues that must be resolved first, which I
have not gotten to yet.

## Features
* rSquirrel syntax highlighting
* Snippets to write code faster
